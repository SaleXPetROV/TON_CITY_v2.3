# invocation. With ~11 jobs (some running every minute) that produced a
# continuous stream of new connection pools — the driver's pool cleanup and
# GC lag caused thousands of open connections to accumulate on the mongod
# server. On restart the leaking process still held them open while the new
# process opened another full set, which is enough to knock over a modest
# MongoDB instance (or hit the 'too many open files' ulimit).
#
# We now keep exactly ONE shared client per Python process. All jobs read
# `_get_shared_db()` and every previous `client.close()` inside a job is now
# a no-op (the pool lives for the whole process lifetime).
